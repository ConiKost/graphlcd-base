GraphLCD base package Revision History
--------------------------------------

2007-02-25: Version 0.1.5
- added missing include path definition (thanks to Wolfgang Astleitner)
- replaced unsigned long long with uint64_t
- added missing includes
- increased VER_MAJOR for glcdgraphics library as interface changed in an incompatible way (thanks to Tobias Grimm)
- changed type of fbp (framebuffer pointer) to void*. Compare fbp against MAP_FAILED to test for success of mmap. This should fix a x86_64 compile error.
- ks0108: clear data lines after display refresh to fix problems with display contrast that occur under some conditions.


2007-02-04: Version 0.1.4

  - showpic: changed setting of brightness to use value from config structure
  - new tool lcdtestpattern to display a test pattern on a LCD (thanks to Alexander Rieger)


2006-01-15: Version 0.1.3
- Added a major.minor.micro version to the libraries starting with 1.0.0
- Moved usage of DESTDIR from serveral Makefiles to Make.config (thanks to
  Lucian Muresan).
- Moved Freetype2 dependency from Make.config to Makefile of libglcdgraphics
  (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Creating an additional symlink for the library files to be found during
  making the tools that need them (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Updated serdisplib driver (thanks to Wolfgang Astleitner).
- KS0108 driver: Added an alternative way of setting the display control lines
  (same as in old versions). It is selectable through graphlcd configfile
  parameter "Control".
- Using default values for width and height in case they are zero, too
  (thanks to Tobias Grimm).
- Added cSerialPort class.
- Added driver for my AVR controlled display.


2005-09-17: Version 0.1.2
- split off drivers from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD driver library
  (libglcddrivers)
- split off graphics and font handling from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD
  graphics library (libglcdgraphics)
- split off tools from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD base package
- almost completely rewritten graphics and font handling
- added configuration file to hold the driver-specific options
- changed driver interface
- adopted the tools' code to use the new driver and graphics API
- glcddrivers: new driver noritake800 for Noritake 800(A) series
  displays (thanks to Lucian Muresan)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a NULL-pointer exception in cBitmap::DrawCharacter
  when skipPixels is equal to width of the character and SubBitmap
  returns NULL, which was not tested for (thanks to Malte Schröder for
  reporting this one)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a wrong return value in cBitmap::DrawCharacter in
  case skipPixels > 0 which prevented scrolling from working right.
- now compiles with gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.x
- added missing #includes
- new tool showtext: allows showing a text on the LCD, see
  README.showtext for details.
- glcddrivers: fixed a too early port release in sed1330 driver (thanks
  to Matthias Huber)
- glcddrivers: sed1330: added missing horizontal scrolling
  initialization. Now, there should be no displaced display any longer.
  (thanks to Wolfgang Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: Now serdisplib is loaded dynamically using libdl. So, no
  INCLUDE_SERDISPLIB define is needed any longer (thanks to Wolfgang
  Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: fixed gu256x64-3900 driver: Now sizes other than 256x64
  should work. (thanks to Detlef Ruge and Ralf Müller)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::DrawText that prevented scrolling
  from working.
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::SubBitmap.
- glcdgraphics: changed the interface of DrawText and DrawCharacter of
  cBitmap class.
- glcdgraphics: extended font attributes to better support converted true
  type fonts. Also changed font file format to support this attributes.
- glcdgraphics: the lastChange attribute of cImage now is 64 bits wide.
- crtfont: extended it to support the new font attributes
- crtfont: changed file format of description files. Now the font
  attributes are given by its names, p. e. lineheight:20. Look in
  README.crtfont for details.
- new tool genfont: allows converting of true type fonts to GraphLCD
  fonts using freetype2 library. You have to uncomment HAVE_FREETYPE2 in
  Make.config to use it.
- added new fonts verdana and verdana bold in sizes 9 to 29 converted by
  genfont.
- glcdgraphics: Added additional type casts to std::min calls to make it
  compile on x86-64 (thanks to Stefan Bergler).
- glcddrivers: fixed a bug in serdisp.c. When using direct IO the port
  string was truncated (thanks to Stefan Bergler).
- glcddrivers: Added method cConfig::GetConfigIndex for getting a
  configuration by its name (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- Added some $(DESTDIR) all over the Makefiles (thanks to Lucian Muresan).
- glcddrivers: sed1330: Added setting of CS line in 6800 mode (thanks to
  Wolfgang Astleitner).
- glcdgraphics: Added FreeType2 support based on patch by Lucian Muresan.
  - You have to set HAVE_FREETYPE2 in Make.config to enable this
  - Added some helper functions to GLCD::cFont class
- glcddrivers: ks0108: Improved timings: Made setting of display control
  lines like defined in the controller's data sheet. This fixes problems
  with some display types. Thanks to Matthias Breitbach for providing a
  LCD of that type.
- glcddrivers: gu256x64-3900:
  - Corrected calculation of m_nTimingAdjustCmd.
  - Added a test for RefreshDisplay config value to prevent a floating
    point exception to occur when it is set to zero.
